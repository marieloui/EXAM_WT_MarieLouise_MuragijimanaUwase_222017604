online Therapy platforms are online services designed to connect individuals with
             licensed therapists and mental health professionals through various digital means, 
             such as video calls, messaging, or phone calls. These platforms offer an accessible,
              convenient, and often more affordable alternative to traditional in-person therapy sessions.
